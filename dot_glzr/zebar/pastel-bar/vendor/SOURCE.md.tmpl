# Zebar client restoration

`zebar.js` is an external dependency restored by `.chezmoiexternal.toml`;
the bundle and extracted third-party source are not stored in this repository.
Chezmoi downloads the pinned bundle, checks its unpatched SHA256, and passes it
through `filter-zebar.ps1`. The filter verifies both hashes and writes UTF-8
without a BOM or an added newline.

- Download: https://esm.sh/zebar@3.0.0/es2022/zebar.bundle.mjs

The filter changes exactly `shell_write",{processId:` to `shell_write",{pid:`
and `shell_kill",{processId:` to `shell_kill",{pid:` (one occurrence each).
This matches the Zebar 3.3.1 desktop command arguments:
